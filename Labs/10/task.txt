Exercise: Simple Grade Calculator

Description:

Create a JavaScript program that calculates and displays the grade of a student based on their numerical score. The program should utilize variables, functions, and basic control flow structures such as if statements, while loops, and switch statements.

Requirements:

 - Define variables to store the student's name, numerical score, and grade.
 - Write a function to calculate the grade based on the numerical score.
 - Implement a user interface that prompts the user to enter the student's name and numerical score.
 - Use if statements to handle different grade ranges and display corresponding messages.
 - Incorporate a while loop to validate the input and ensure the numerical score is within the valid range (0-100).
 - Display the calculated grade to the user.
 - Exercise Steps:

Setup
    - Initialize variables for student name, numerical score, and grade.
    - Define a function named calculateGrade to calculate the grade based on the numerical score.
User Input
    - Prompt the user to enter the student's name and numerical score using prompt().
Grade Calculation
    - Implement the calculateGrade function to determine the grade based on the numerical score.
    - Define grade ranges and assign grades accordingly (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
Display Output
    - Use if statements to display different messages based on the calculated grade (e.g., "Congratulations! You got an A!").
Input Validation
    - Use a while loop to validate the numerical score input and ensure it is within the valid range (0-100).
